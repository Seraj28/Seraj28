## 🧑‍💻 About Me  

I am a **self-driven MERN Stack Developer** with strong backend fundamentals and hands-on experience building **real-world, scalable web applications**.  

I have worked extensively with **Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB**, and modern frontend tools like **React**. Alongside development, I actively practice **Data Structures & Algorithms in C++** to strengthen my problem-solving skills for product-based companies.  

I believe in **building projects from scratch**, understanding concepts deeply, and writing clean, maintainable code rather than just following tutorials.
